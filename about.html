            <p  class="about-text animated fadeInUp _2">That is it.  I am a maker at heart.  I love tinkering and playing with things myself until I have made something that is amazing.  I built my first computer when I was in 4th grade, only because I wanted to.  I made my first app with my father using MIT app inventor that same year because I wanted to create something, I wanted something different.  I shoot film photography because I wanted not to take photos, I wanted to make them.  The act of treating my film with chemicals and creating a physical emulsion of a moment entrances me.  That is why I build software; I am a maker. </p>
