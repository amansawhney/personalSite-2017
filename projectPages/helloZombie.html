                As a part of the make school summer academy, I elected to create a game called Hello Zombie.
                <br>
                I was responsible for thinking and building an application, and as a result, it is as weird and random as my incredibly 'special' mind.

            <p class="text-left animated fadeIn _5">On the surface, this is an addicting game. However, once you read deep between the lines, this game is actually much more. The man in the game is meant to be a projection of who he really wants to be. The landscape represents his mind, an endless landscape. The zombies are his inner struggles, as he works to resolve them with the blaster, which is a metaphor for deep thought and self-resolution. The night sky in the background and the multitude of the zombies, representing struggles, indicates that the man the game is about is going through a dark time in his life. This game provokes deep thought and is a very interesting psychological example.</p>
